**Introduction**  
At the 2015 United Nations Climate Conference, 195 countries committed to the Paris Agreement's climate target, aiming for net zero carbon emissions. Buildings contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, making Net Zero Carbon Buildings (NZCB) a critical area in achieving this target. To raise public awareness of the importance of NZCB and to help users understand the journey toward achieving net zero in buildings, this project introduces the "Move to Net Zero" physical building dashboard.  

This dashboard serves as an interactive tool to promote the concept of NZCB, encouraging users to engage in daily actions that reduce carbon emissions. By leveraging IoT technology, the dashboard provides real-time data on electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and solar energy usage, offering users valuable insights into the building's environmental impact.  

**Research Question**  
This project seeks to answer the question: How can a physical dashboard displaying real-time data related to carbon neutrality effectively enhance communication and foster net-zero practices among the general public?  

**Key Features**

Data Visualization Tools: The dashboard utilizes gauge displays, e-paper, and a dot matrix module to communicate information in an accessible and engaging manner.  
IoT Integration: The system is powered by ESP32 microcontrollers, ensuring efficient data processing and real-time updates.  

**Case Study: UCL Student Center**  
The project includes a case study of the UCL Student Center, analyzing its electricity consumption and carbon emissions over the past two years. The findings indicate significant progress toward NZCB, with nearly 50% of the building's electricity now sourced from renewable energy.  

**User Feedback**  
A survey of 32 users who interacted with the dashboard revealed that the device successfully communicates key information about the building's energy usage and carbon footprint. However, it also highlighted the need for more intuitive content presentation to make the data easier to understand.  

**Future Work**  
Future iterations of the "Move to Net Zero" dashboard will focus on:  
Enriching Energy Information: Providing more comprehensive data about the building's energy use.  
Improving User Experience: Simplifying the dashboard's interface to make it more user-friendly and accessible.  
Add ultrasonic sensors: Counting users more precisely and collect avarage usage time for further research.
